\caption{\label{fig:data-all} The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) scores for each cue across all categories ('ALL') and for each category. A value of 0.5 represents pure chance, and a value of 1 represents perfect performance. The AUC score can be interpreted as the probability that, given two pairs of basic-level words, of which one is from the same superordinate category, the pairs are correctly classified using their  cue-based similarity.}\label{fig:data-all}
